We pledge to resist

This should be played at high volume

the pledge to resist:
we believe that as people living in the united states it is our responsibility to resist the injustices done by our government in our names.
not in our name will you wage endless war.
there can be no more deaths.
no more transfusions of blood for oil.
not in our name will you invade countries, bomb civilians, kill more children
not by our hands will we supply weapons and funding for the annihilation of families on foreign soil.
not by our hearts will we allow whole peoples or countries to be deemed evil.
not by our will and not in our name.
we pledge alliance with those who have come under attack for voicing opposition to the war or for their religion or ethnicity.
we pledge to make common cause with the people of the world to bring about justice, freedom and peace.

Another world is possible and we pledge to make it real.
