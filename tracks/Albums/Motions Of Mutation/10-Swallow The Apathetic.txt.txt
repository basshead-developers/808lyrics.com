The US intends to rule the world by force and to do it permanently. 
This should be played at high volume. 
I think you are right undoubtedly that most people seem to be accepting the war on terrorism but I believe that, that that acceptance is very superficial. It’s very thin, I believe it’s based on the fact that people do not have information given to them by the media. Let me give you an example. 

Today we have a series on energy called the end of the age of oil. To understand why 9/11 happened and to understand why in mid-October 2002 the United States is on the brink of an imperial war of aggression against Iraq. One must understand the world is facing an energy crisis. A crisis based not on market or political forces. But on physical reality, the world is running out of the cheap oil and natural gas that powered the industrial revolution and the information age. “This is not about oil” “Some estimates indicate that Iraq could have as much as 220 billion barrels of oil that has not yet been discovered”. “The US position, of course is going to be that this is not about oil.” “Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward. And freedom will be defended” “This is about the war on terrorism”. “But our responsibility to history is already clear. To answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.” “This is not about oil, this is about the war on terrorism.” “I find the foreign policy of the bush administration exceedingly dangerous.” “Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists”. “Though the terrorist threat is real and we must defend against it. We are going about it the wrong way. What makes the situation so dangerous is that nobody dares to say something. The nation is in danger, therefore it’s unpatriotic to criticize our leader, that is not what has made this country great. The strength of this country lies in the declaration of independence, the bill of rights, and freedom of speech and polls.
