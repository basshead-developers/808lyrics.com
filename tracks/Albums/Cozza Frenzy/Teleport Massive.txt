I'm a glitch modulator, sip on the data
Verb conjugator, plus herb inhalator
Feed off the haters, opposite of krypton
Give me more power and I'm fit to get my sip on
Move with the hip sha-shake that chassis
Clean on the get but still get nasty
Dance floor trashy with cups and glitter
(Dump that picture)
Mugshot mean like my name Nick Nolte
Hard day’s night please don't insult me
Did a lot of livin’ in the past 6 minutes
Cold like a blizzard when the flow get in it
Space time jumper, teleport massive
Land like a cat, true boy fashion
Always on fours, two techniques each
Hold to the beats while we storm up the beach
All I wanna do is teleport massive
(Throw they hands up in the air yeah we feelin em)
All I wanna do is teleport massive
(Throw they hands up in the air yeah we feelin em,
we'll be wheelin em, show you top dealin em)
Teleport massive
Mind on fire cause I bleed petrol

We let go so the beats can control
Move real slow like im sippin sizzurp
Land of the oaks teamed up with the bizzer
Pumped for the future, here comes the rooster
Melonhead man so always feel super
Super deluxe bassnec with the cuts
Live from babylon and dub-a-dub-a-deep
The girls go nuts, the boys go nuts
But none can touch what the king dreamed up
He team ringed up my team two gritty
Writtin on walls till we deep our city
We three sixty, you forty five
Now we see who keep the party live
Go on give it up cause your boy get cup
If you really feel fly go, put your hands up
All I wanna do is teleport massive
(Throw they hands up in the air yeah we feelin em)
All I wanna do is teleport massive
(Throw they hands up in the air yeah we feelin em,
we'll be wheelin em, show you top dealin em)
Teleport massive
