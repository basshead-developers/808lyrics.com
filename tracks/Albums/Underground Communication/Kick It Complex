Kick it -morphasize

World wide, that’s right world wide metamorphasize
World wide, not to be categorized
Just when you got me figured out I metamorphasize
Worldwide that’s right, worldwide wide that’s right
Worldwide that’s right, that’s right

Some people like the way I kick it complex
Dig into my lyrics break down my concepts
Gettin’ intricate with sentences until its test
Loosens up your ligaments, toes to biceps
Mixin’ opposition even those who contest
Agressive is my nature in sex and mic checks
In the peace i keep the peace, at least i try my best
Bless mic for it’s utility, Sling it out the west (x2)
I I kick it complex
kick it complex break down my concepts…
Kick it complex kick it…complex
break down my concepts 
Break down my concepts concepts concepts
down down down down…… 

World wide, that’s right worldwide metamorphasize
World wide, not to be categorized
Just when you got me figured out I metamorphasize
World wide that’s right, worldwide wide that’s right (x2)
