So, this is where the party at
I need room
Move a little bit and groove cos' honey boo
Came to stir it up like cups of gin and juice.
Don't slap me cos' I'm not in the mood.

Got to keep the game on tight, yes I do.

Take me to a [telly and rocks, and rocks, and rocks, and rocks...]

This is an attitude. Home grown and outta tune.
True definition of hip hop [my crew]

My say ain't criminal, but yet subliminal.
Science and rhyme, please check your rappin'.
Pimpin' aint so easy and I never be half steppin'.
MC's got me laughin'. Pulling out guns and shit.
Flip this ni&%@'s [word what has ever spits.]
