The moment I've always dreamed of
It's beginning
You loved me so much
I accepted it
The sun and the bright breezes bright as my mood
Come to me
I feel so happy
The sky is open to us And by my side I have you 
Standing with a bright smile, yes you are blue Sea 
Just being together like this in the same time I like it 
Your smile on your face is no longer what Do you want 
Under the blue sky, you and I are like this I'm in love 
I feel so happy oh 
The sky is open to us And by my side I have you 
Standing with a bright smile, yes you are blue Sea 
There's no sadness anymore I know we love each other under the sun 
The sky is open to us And by my side
You're standing with a bright smile
You are the blue sea
The sky is open to us And by my side
You're standing with a bright smile
Yes you are the blue sea you are the blue sea
The sky is open to us And by my side
You're standing with a bright smile
Yes you are the blue sea you are the blue sea
I love you I love you
I love you I love you
