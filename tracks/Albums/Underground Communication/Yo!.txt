Something like "renacimiento es como yo vivo, yes" which is think would translate into something in the neighbourhood of "rebirth is how I live"... the rest of the snippets are about dancing. I can hear "bailo, bail√© in da ritma", "I dance, I danced in the rhythm" and I can distinguish "salsa" and "hiphop". Also I can hear "que tener limites", "entrenando de puntas" both of which I can't translate but the first must have something to do with boundaries, and I think I hear "dime si tu m'extrenas" which would mean, "tell me if you miss me". That's all I can make of it :S I think there might be some slang in it aswell.
