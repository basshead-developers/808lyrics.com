Voodoo symphony (x8)

Voodoo symphony
In the M-I-N-D
Wav files rub on your brain files constantly

Open frequency
Coming way louder than a wire that sweapt the beat
Bomb threat on the deck and right where you are apt to be
Jumpin off hard in the front and the back of me
Mash it up properly. (x2)

Select Frequency 

Mash it up properly

Mas-mash it up properly

Now Let me see how you humpty dance
We should get together while we got the chance, to
Yep, yeah, you know how we do
Old school, new school, and combine the two

And damn, it seems you're doin it justice
I love the way you move it when we show up and bust this
Trust it, gets better ya'll, cocktail Molotov
Sweat it off, digital to analog

I think that's it
That's it

Mash it up properly
