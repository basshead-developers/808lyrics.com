This is the story of the honey tree
You can read along with me in your book
You will know it is time to turn the page
When you hear the chimes ring like this

Let’s begin now

We can learn
And if the knowledge is given to everyone
Then we can have lots of years
And soon everyone will be strong
Not just the ones who are chosen
Because sometimes even if you’re the leader
You need to be strong, you can get tired

Everyone

We’re gonna elevate, just to stimulate your mind state
Regenerate every sound where you dwell.
