Before a revolution can start in the streets
It first has to happen in the mind, let me speak
We seek peace and justice, the system won’t give it
Can’t talk the talk without walkin’ it and linvin’ it
More than slogans and some banners
Watch out, Police cameras and scanners
Just because you read a book, that don’t make you conscious
Millions of people fought for freedom before us

We the type of cats that rip the mic like that
With the dialect on the ill mic check
We the type of cats that rip the mic like that
Move ya body like that (Empire strike back)

We the type of cats that rip the mic like that
With the dialect on the ill mic check
We the type of cats that rip the mic like that
Move ya, move ya body like that

We the type, we the type, we the type to strike back

Strike back Strike back Strike back Strike back

Governments ignore us, assholes entrap us 
On-Star cellular phones to track us
Whether, driving a hummer to a rider on a bus
Forget the dollar bill, and the people we trust
Are so more powerful than screamin’ and shootin’ 
Need more folks to live for revolution 
Make a plan, give a helpin’ hand, protect the land
Got a special message for all woman and man
