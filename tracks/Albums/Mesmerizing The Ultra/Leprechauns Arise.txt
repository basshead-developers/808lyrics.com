Been a long road, so many souls sold
Killing for possessions in a world of obsessions
I heard she craves spirit and the gods crave
That gave disaster, chaos to laughter

That gave disaster, and chaos to laughter

She craves spirit

she craves spirit and the gods crave
That gave disaster, and chaos to laughter

Laughter, laughter, laughter

Been a long road, so many souls sold
Killing for possessions in a world of obsessions
I heard she craves spirit and the gods crave
That gave disaster, chaos to laughter

Most still scared to drink freedom’s potion
Contemplate, actually fantasize commotion
Strange devotion to a world stolen, killing loudly, proudly 

Big deals, cheap thrills
Keeping the drill
The more we lose the will 
The more innocent blood spills

Dominate a contest
Military complex
Wartime agenda
With a dictator reflex

War time! Revolutionary!
Go back to work next thing to get paid
Talk, start walking, let’s talk, stalk a walk
Do what is right, and put a little wobble in your walk.
