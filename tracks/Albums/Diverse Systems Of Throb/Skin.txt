Skin I am tired, of livin’ in this body
Cause you know that it’s hard 
For a human to keep on being sometimes
I drive in my car and I spend a little too much money
But I guess it’s all a part
So I put my foot on the break I just can’t fake it no-oh 
So I put my foot on the break I just can’t fake it no-oh no no

So I put my foot on the break 

So I put my foot on the break 

Wrestling with the industry
A subject to humanity
A question of my liberty
I cross the street 
I cross the street
Rattling off is the news at 8
Ingesting the mess that they delegate
To the pros I mean, foes
So they can populate
On the system we must infiltrate

Soaking in pollution, we’ve outgrown this institution
Bah du du dah dah Bah du du dah dah 
We won’t come to solutions just by simply be humans
Bah du du dah dah Bah du du dah dah 
Let’s first realize it takes our lives to read between the lines
Bah du du dah dah Bah du du dah dah 
We won’t have any change if there is only one Kind
Bah du du dah dah Bah du du dah dah 

I cross the street 
I cross the street
I cross the streeeeeet

When I'm crossing the street I find
my mind's intertwined with the lines divine.
When I'm crossing the street I find
my mind's intertwined with the lines divine.

As I move to the rhythms of a luminous tune,
The ominous structures of the flowers in bloom.
The arrays of their orbits penetrate my temple,
seed bloom seems to be my soul's example.
As I zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay,
my oh my all the games people play.

I've been a witness to the ways of man,
I stood in silence with my head in my hands.
Mouth dropped wide open, blood in my eyes,
I laid to help with it’s weight on my thighs.

Crucified and divided with lines of separation,
wrapped up in this half-assed story of creation.
Jealous god on this side, loving god on this side,
while the presence of the goddess too long has been denied.

Should we follow the leaders who would make us blind
believers,
relinquishing our freedoms, condemning all the dreamers?
Should we retreat the tools and potentials of our youths
waging war on third world countries while we're in Armani
suits?
Should we repeat the toils, trials and tribulations,
feeding masses empty words, herds of verbal masturbation?

"Meditation is the key" my master taught me,
"Don't make a martyr out of me" said Mahatma Ghandi.
